              UF SG has had scandal after scandal revealed by The Alligator and other news sources. While everyday corruption and nepotism can be seen by watching the actions of the Senate, Supreme Court and Executive ticket, there are certain issues that are large enough to warrant press coverage.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 text-left">While UF Administration continues to allow this to happen, it is still important for people, particuarly UF Students, to understand how this government functions. These are a few of the most notable scandals that UF SG has been entrenched in.</p>

              <p class="mb-3">While it may now be older, this particular case had serious real-world repercussions. In 1995, UF student Charles Grapski ran for Student Body President. It would not end well.</p>
              <p class="mb-3">Florida Blue Key, an exclusive honor society that is considered a pipeline into Florida politics, was known to back what was considered “The System” party on campus. What happened next was best <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1998-04-19-9804190028-story.html" target="_blank">described by The Orlando Sentinel in 1998</a>:</p>
              <br><p class="mb-3 text-center"><em>“Two days before the vote, Grapski woke up to find the campus plastered with yellow fliers asking, "Do you want this criminal as your student body president?" The flier was a copy of Grapski's arrest record on drunken driving and other charges. Someone, though, had altered the document to add two false charges: sexual battery on a minor and lewd and lascivious conduct. Grapski, who was working with sexual-abuse victims at the time, lost the election. The winner: the candidate for the Blue Key-backed Focus Party.”</em></p><br>
              <p class="mb-3">In 1998, Grapski <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/U-of-Florida-Student-Wins/98409" target="_blank">won his defamation suit</a> and was awarded $250,000 in damages from a jury from Florida Blue Key, $100,000 more than he originally requested in his suit. In 2002, The Gainesville Sun reported on Grapski accusing John McGovern (One of the individuals reportedly <a href="https://apnews.com/5ea6b70315cdd87c4a4845fe7e4893d7" target="_blank">involved in the scandal</a>) of <a href="https://www.gainesville.com/article/LK/20020722/News/604173984/GS/" target="_blank">filing for bankruptcy</a> as a way to avoid paying $100,000 that he owed Grapski from the initial suit.</p>
              <p class="mb-3">While this case may have been focused on an individual, the information that came out about the organization FBK is still referenced and believed to be true to this today. The case was <a href="https://www.alligator.org/news/campus/blue-key-membership-controlled-by-powerful-few/article_c7b6155c-8dcc-11e1-b250-001a4bcf887a.html" target="_blank">mentioned by The Alligator</a> when discussing who the organization decides to tap. Additionally, this <a href="https://www.alligator.org/opinion/columns/uf-student-leadership-controlled-by-system/article_c0bf10f8-9858-11e3-af86-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">2014 Alligator article</a> has a good recap of the entire situation and why it’s relevant today.</p>

Speakers discuss campaign tactics such as changing the “I Voted” stickers (something that the supposedly non-partisan Supervisor of Elections is in charge of), removing the then-independent party Student Alliance’s campaign material, forcing Greek students to vote by withholding food and alcohol and other problematic plans.</p>
              <br><p class="mb-3 text-center"><em>“Student Alliance, this is ridiculous, these people don’t have friends. Like you think I’m kidding, these guys don’t have friends. It’s not funny, like these kids are the kids that want to take down the Greek system.”</em></p><br>
              <p class="mb-3">This was more confirmation of things that had been said before- students are forced to vote by collecting stickers and The System Party claiming the Independent Party is anti-greek (no proof of that claim has been shown in researching for this website). It also confirmed the general sentiment that Greek students set up The System specifically to keep themselves in power.</p>

When asked, Senate leadership claimed the meeting had been posted on the Public Notice Board, but it was not there that following week when I checked.</p>
